4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 a) Processor 386+.
 b) VGA-compatible videocard.
 c) 4 MB free XMS memory.
 d) DOS 5.00+.

 Warning!  Test  should  not  work correctly in multitasking environment
 such  as  Windows, WindowsNT, and other. Not recommended to use test
 with memory menagers like EMM386 or QEMM and programs of caching data.

 For testing IDE-ATAPI CD drives is recommended to create MS-DOS system
 diskette and copy on it files: mscdex.sys, oakcdrom.sys or asuscd.sys
 and config.sys following contents:

 DEVICE=OAKCDROM.SYS /D:MSCD001
 INSTALL=MSCDEX.EXE /D:MSCD001
 or
 DEVICE=ASUSCD.SYS /D:MSCD001 /DMA
 INSTALL=MSCDEX.EXE /D:MSCD001
 or
 DEVICE=ASUSCD.SYS /D:MSCD001 /UDMA
 INSTALL=MSCDEX.EXE /D:MSCD001

 Load system from this diskette for properly testing.
 You may will also be loaded from Windows'98 repair disk for testing
 IDE or SCSI CD drives.
